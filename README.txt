READ ME *******************

To run these three crawler, you need to make sure your python version is 2.7.10

and have installed the libraries: urllib2, re, time, BeautifulSoup, and urllib

You can run any python file in the submitted folder by using command line "python theNameOfTheFile.py"

like run 'webCrawler HW1.py', u type "python webCrawler HW1.py"

To make sure u get the exactly the number of urls in the output url-files, u can rename the submitted url-files,

or you can change the output urls-file name in the code line "f = open("Task 2-A.txt", "a")"

or clean the urls in them, before you run the python file, otherwise you will get more urls than expected, thank you.

P.S. depends on ur network, if u use download function in 'webCrawler HW1.py', it might be slow sometime
